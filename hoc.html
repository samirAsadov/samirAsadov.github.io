        <p>Hour of Code is a one-hour lesson that introduces to programming and 
          computer science. Its main purpose is to demistify the concept of "code" and 
          make coding process understandable and interesting for everyone. Our team 
          started preparations from thorough studying of the provided instructions. Next,
          each of us got familiar with the events that were held in the previous
          years by other students. You can learn more about previous Hour of Code events in Azerbaijan
         <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/KodSaatÄ±" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.
          It was very useful since it helped us to understand
          the details of the Hour of Code event and provided some inspiration and ideas. 
          After this, we arranged a meeting in order to discuss further actions. We 
          decided to split the work so each member of the team could make his own 
          contribution to the upcoming event. Unal found us the school and arranged 
          the event. Nasib's part was to prepare the speech and activities for
          the participants. Samir prepared the presentation and certificates. Overall,
          we all made our contributions and now we are looking forward to teach children
          the basics of coding and explain them how software works!
