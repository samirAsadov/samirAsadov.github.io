        <p>Creating website is a great opportunity to learn markup languages and
           understand how websites work. The team was very excited about this project,
           and we started right away. First, we needed to learn HTML and CSS markup
           languages, since it was our first experience in website development. In addition
           to this, we also studied basics of JavaScript programming language. After this,
           our team held several online meetings during which we were working on the website together,
           so each member could contribute to the development. First, the content was included
           and the HTML layers of each page were created. Next, we started designing the website
           with the use of the CSS. Overall, each of us offered the ideas and they were included
           in these webpages.
